A modern and user-friendly payment tracking system for students of the **Department of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE)** at **Northern University of Business & Technology Khulna (NUBTK)**. This project solves a real problem where the university only provides payment data in an Excel (.xls) sheet, making it difficult for students to understand their dues, payments, and summaries.

## 💡 Why This Project?

Our university only provides a raw `.xls` sheet for payment details which is not intuitive or accessible. To fix this, I built this platform to help fellow students of CSE easily:

- Check their semester fees
- Track how much they have paid
- View remaining dues
- Access their payment summaries in a clean and interactive way
